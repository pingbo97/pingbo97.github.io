			<div id="story">Pingbo's Story</div>
			<div id="description1">Born in Guangzhou, China in 1997, Pingbo moved to the United States with his parents when he was three years old.
			</div>
			<div id="description2">Growing up in Spokane, Washington, Pingbo always had greater aspirations and believed he would one day make a difference. Upon being accepted to the University of California, Berkeley, he took a few beginner-level coding courses and created the basis of Inspire, the soon-to-be premier online photo sharing platform.</div>
			<div id="description3">Inspire will soon be the leading photo sharing platform on the web, on track to surpass Instagram, Flickr, and Facebook. Its success will be unprecedented and the company will go public in the next five years. Now Pingbo just needs to get the necessary support to finish all the bells and whistles on the site.</div>
